# Online Mobile Store

Develop an “Online Mobile Store” using React. Application should display the list of mobiles. User should be able to search mobiles, view details of the product, add the product to the cart and place order. Following are the key functional aspects:

•	Show the list of products
• This list of products should be fetched from local json server via an api call (refer to https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

•	Filter the list, based on search

•	Sort the list of products on the basis of price (High to Low, Low to High)

•	View details of the product item

•	Add item to the cart from the list as well as from the product details screen

•	Cart management (Change the quantity, if item already in the cart increase or decrease the quantity, also item can be removed from cart

•	If user is not logged in show the login button in the header

•	Place the order

•	User should be able to view the application without login but when he/she wants to place the order then user must be logged in.

•	Show the popup when order placed successfully with random order id

•	Logout should appear in dropdown when clicked on username (when logged in)

•	Unit Testing should be done of at least 2 components

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
